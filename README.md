# UPWayPoint
📍 UP WayPoint is a map that utilizes the Google Maps API to display a map of the campus of UP Diliman. Users with a UP email may sign up and place pins on certain points of interest. Both UP and non-UP users can then use the map as a reference for all the notable spots within the campus, or as a means of navigation.
