# UPWayPoint
📍 UP WayPoint is a map that utilizes the Google Maps API to display a map of the campus of UP Diliman. Users with a UP email may sign up and place pins on certain points of interest. Both UP and non-UP users can then use the map as a reference for all the notable spots within the campus, or as a means of navigation.

_This is a course requirement for CS 191/CS192 Software Engineering Courses of the Department of Computer Science, College of Engineering, University of the Philippines, Diliman under the guidance of Prof. Ma. Rowena C. Solamo for the AY 2025-2026._
